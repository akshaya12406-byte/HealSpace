    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    This project requires API keys for Firebase and Google AI services.

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following keys:

    ```
    # Your Google API Key for Genkit/Gemini
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

    # The following keys are found in your Firebase project settings
    # You can get these by running `firebase apps:sdkconfig` or from the Firebase Console
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
    ```

    > **Note:** The `firebaseConfig` object in `src/firebase/config.ts` is populated from these environment variables.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Running Genkit Flows

The AI flows (chatbot, sentiment analysis) are managed by Genkit. To inspect, debug, and test these flows, use the Genkit development UI.

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

This will start the Genkit development server, and you can view traces at `http://localhost:4000`.
